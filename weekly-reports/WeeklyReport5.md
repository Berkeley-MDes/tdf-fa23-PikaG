# Weekly Report 5 - 09/21/2023 - 09/27/2023

## Summary
During last Thursday's class, we proceeded with the Photon2 setup and linked our devices to the Berkeley IoT Wi-Fi. Subsequently, we explored on basic programming to gain a better understanding of Photon2's input and output capabilities. In this week's Monday class, we engaged in group discussions about the ideation for Project 2 and conducted brainstorming sessions across various domains.

## Exploring TUI
This semester, I enrolled in another course, TUI. In this class, I learned to utilize Arduino to develop interactive programs. Looking ahead to our upcoming Project 2, I believe I can leverage the skills acquired from the course. I'd like to share an assignment I completed last week for the TUI class.

For this assignment, my objective was to generate a visualization of colorful ink drips using Processing while controlling the drips with an FSR. I began by connecting the FSR to the circuit and subsequently configured the StandardFirmata sketch in Arduino. To achieve the desired visual effect of drips, I initially delved into various tutorials, thoroughly examined the code, and eventually developed my own custom sketch to create the visual effect. I also tried to embeded the FSR into a ball to enhance the intuitiveness of the interactive motion.

## Speculation
During Thursday's discussion, our group was assigned the category of entertainment and recreation. Personally, I found this topic quite engaging and I'm inclined to further explore it for my Project 2. Within the discussion, we generated three potential ideas. The first concept was around creating an enhanced chess experience for elderly individuals. We considered a scenario where elderly people engage in a game of chess in a community square, and we aim to implement modifications that would better cater to their needs. The second idea centers on music + environment. One specific concept involves incorporating wind chimes into an interactive installation. The third proposal was about the development of a multiplayer racing game, similar to Nintendo Switch Sports, that not only provides an engaging experience but also extends the enjoyment to remote players.

TUIs can transform entertainment by offering hands-on, interactive interfaces for a more immersive experience. I'm particularly interested in exploring their synergy with AR in the entertainment sector.
