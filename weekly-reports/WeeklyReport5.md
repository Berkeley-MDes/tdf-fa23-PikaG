# Weekly Report 5 - 09/21/2023 - 09/27/2023

## Summary
During last Thursday's class, we proceeded with the Photon2 setup and linked our devices to the Berkeley IoT Wi-Fi. Subsequently, we explored on basic programming to gain a better understanding of Photon2's input and output capabilities. In this week's Monday class, we engaged in group discussions about the ideation for Project 2 and conducted brainstorming sessions across various domains.

## Exploring TUI
This semester, I enrolled in another course, TUI. In this class, I learned to utilize Arduino to develop interactive programs. Looking ahead to our upcoming Project 2, I believe I can leverage the skills acquired from the course. I'd like to share an assignment I completed last week for the TUI class.

For this assignment, my objective was to generate a visualization of colorful ink drips using Processing while controlling the drips with an FSR. I began by connecting the FSR to the circuit and subsequently configured the StandardFirmata sketch in Arduino. To achieve the desired visual effect of drips, I initially delved into various tutorials, thoroughly examined the code, and eventually developed my own custom sketch to create the visual effect. I also tried to embeded the FSR into a ball to enhance the intuitiveness of the interactive motion.

## Speculation
