# Weekly Report 3 - 09/07/2023 - 09/14/2023

## Summary 
This week I worked on project 1 to create a personalized cell phone stand. To achieve it, I went through 4 stages, ideation and sketching, modeling and iteration, 3D printing, and reflection. In this report I will record my design in detail and also reflected on the challenges and potential future improvement.

## Project 1: Computational Design

#### Step 1: Ideation and Sketching
Before sketching my design, I first browsed the cell phone stands on the market and summarized the ideas that interested me in these designs. While browsing, I was also summarizing my needs for cell phone stands in life.

I drew multiple sketches for different design ideas. Considering feasibility and fun, and finally selected the design for a cell phone stand + audio amplifier.
