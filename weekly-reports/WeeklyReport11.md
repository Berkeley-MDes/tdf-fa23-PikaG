## Reflection on Project 3
Last Thursday after watching my peer's impressive project presentation videos, I gained insights into how I can better utilize the LLM as a design tool. For the upcoming final project, I plan to consider incorporating the LLM, drawing inspiration from my peers' use of APIs to link the chatbot to their own websites with visually appealing UI designs. Some even trained the chatbot in specific styles, like Laozi and Shakespeare, which has left me quite inspired. I look forward to conducting a similar experiment in the near future.
