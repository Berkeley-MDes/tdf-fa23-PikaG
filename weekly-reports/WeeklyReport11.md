## Reflection on Project 3
Last Thursday after watching my peer's impressive project presentation videos, I gained insights into how I can better utilize the LLM as a design tool. For the upcoming final project, I plan to consider incorporating the LLM, drawing inspiration from my peers' use of APIs to link the chatbot to their own websites with visually appealing UI designs. Some even trained the chatbot in specific styles, like Laozi and Shakespeare, which has left me quite inspired. I look forward to conducting a similar experiment in the near future.

## Speculation on Final Project
**Project Proposal: Integrating Digital Fabrication and Interactive Design for a Living Garden**

**Introduction:**
For my final project, I aim to incorporate the digital fabrication skills acquired from Project 1 with the conceptual framework of Project 2. Drawing inspiration from a piece brought by the speaker on Monday, instead of displaying plant data within a virtual garden scene in Unity, I intend to incorporate an additional screen onto a tangible garden. This screen will display data such as soil moisture and sunlight levels in real-time. The project will take the form of an interactive installation, aiming to create an immersive experience to evoke awareness about environmental change.

**Methodology:**
1. **Digital Fabrication and 3D Printing:**
   - Utilize digital fabrication skills to design and create visually appealing models serving as the tangible garden.
   - Employ 3D printing technology to produce intricate and customized components.

2. **Interactive Screen Integration:**
   - Integrate an additional screen onto the tangible garden to display real-time data on soil moisture and sunlight levels.
   - Implement user-friendly interfaces for intuitive interaction and data visualization.

3. **Dynamic Movement with Servo Motor:**
   - Incorporate servo motors into the 3D-printed models to enable dynamic movement, simulating the garden's "breathing" motion.
   - Program the servo motor to respond to environmental data fluctuations, creating an engaging and immersive experience.
