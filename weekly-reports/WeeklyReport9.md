# Weekly Report 9 - 10/19/2023 - 10/26/2023

## Summary
This week, we completed Project 2 and began Project 3, which involves using LLM to create a digital twin. I enjoyed the tutorial this Monday on providing instructions to the LLM and training our own digital twin. I'm not very familiar with the concept of a digital twin or how to train an LLM. This project is relatively shorter compared to our previous two. I hope I can deliver a good presentation by Monday!
