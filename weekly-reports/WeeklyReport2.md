# Weekly Report 2 - 08/31/2023 - 09/07/2023

## Summary  
This week, I focused on delving deeper into Grasshopper, despite my initial unfamiliarity with it. I diligently read through the project1 description and thoroughly watched the Grasshopper walkthrough video of the simple phone stand. Compared to the previous week, I've gained a much clearer grasp of the procedures and diverse operations involved in parametric modeling using Grasshopper. 

Furthermore, I took the initiative to search for additional Grasshopper tutorials online and diligently followed them to create various models. This exploration process has proven to be incredibly engaging and enlightening. It's fascinating to witness how Grasshopper enables us to translate our ideas into tangible models, and I look forward to further honing my skills in this area.


## Exploration on Grasshopper

- Creating a cylinder in the center of the model to save material. Then trying to use the cylinder solid as a stand instead of the intersection of two spheres.

#### Additional Models

- Besides the project 1 pre-project walkthrough video, I also searched for some Grasshopper tutorials and followed them to generate some simple models. The image below is a model of randomly generated cubes.
