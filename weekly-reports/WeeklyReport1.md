#### Explore the laser cut files

- To perform the laser cut, the initial step involves arranging the files in accordance with the specified requirements. Within Adobe Illustrator, I need to modify the line colors to red; this informs the machine that a cutting action is intended. Then I need to adjust the stroke, with a value of 0.00001 for this particular cut.
- The next step was uploading the file for print. In the UCP software I use **focus view** and **relacate features** to locate my file to the corner of the material.
- Then measuring the thickness of the material and adjust the corresponding material settings in the UCP software.

#### Coducting the print

- **Always do a test cut first!** Since we were pressed for time we choose not to do a test cut before final printing. Consequently, we discovered inconsistencies in the material thickness, leading to incomplete cuts in certain sections. This experience underscores the importance of conducting test cuts before the final printing, as well always measuring the material's thickness **within the working area** to ensure results.

#### Final result

- **Here is a nice phone stand!** Given my limited experience with laser cut, this trial is really excited to me. Thanks to the help of both my peers and Jacobs's design specialists!
