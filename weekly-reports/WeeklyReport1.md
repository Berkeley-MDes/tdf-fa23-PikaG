- Over the course of this week, I completed a portion of the Rhino and Grasshopper tutorial. Currently, I am engaged in the process of both exploring and modifying the provided cell phone stand file. I am new to CAD and learning Rhino and Grasshopper is a challenge for me. Though I am excited exploring CAD and making efforts!

## Laser Cut Cell Phone Stand

#### Explore the laser cut files

</div>

- To perform the laser cut, the initial step involves arranging the files in accordance with the specified requirements. Within Adobe Illustrator, I need to modify the line colors to red; this informs the machine that a cutting action is intended. Then I need to adjust the stroke, with a value of 0.00001 for this particular cut.
- The next step was uploading the file for print. In the UCP software I use **focus view** and **relacate features** to locate my file to the corner of the material.
- Then measuring the thickness of the material and adjust the corresponding material settings in the UCP software.

#### Coducting the print

  </p>
</div>

- **Always do a test cut first!** Since we were pressed for time we choose not to do a test cut before final printing. Consequently, we discovered inconsistencies in the material thickness, leading to incomplete cuts in certain sections. This experience underscores the importance of conducting test cuts before the final printing, as well always measuring the material's thickness **within the working area** to ensure results.

#### Final result

- **Here is a nice phone stand!** Given my limited experience with laser cut, this trial is really excited to me. Thanks to the help of both my peers and Jacobs's design specialists!

## Reflection and Speculation

<div style="display:inline-block">

    <img width="500" alt="speculation1" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-PikaG/assets/74200423/50edaa22-e5c9-4999-bdf3-b36cdda5f327">
    <img width="500" alt="speculation2" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-PikaG/assets/74200423/a5b3f1c7-282f-4681-951f-314fac121f96">
  </p>
</div>

For further improving the model, I have two ideas:

- **Appearance Design.** As shown in the picture above, the ordinary wooden mobile phone holder is designed in the shape of a chair, adding aesthetic value to the item while maintaining a simple structure.
- **Make the angle adjustable.** The angles of the two mobile phone holders in the picture above can be adjusted. This design feature allows the mobile phone holder to better accommodate the needs of users and adapt to various usage scenarios.
