# Weekly Report 4 - 09/14/2023 - 09/21/2023

## Summary
This week, we finished our first project in computational design and moved on to project 2. This time, we'll be utilizing Photon2 (looks very similar to Arduino) for our upcoming project. I took some time this week to get myself familiar with Photon2 by following the provided tutorial and uploading sample programs onto the board. I'm excited about the prospect of creating fun projects in the weeks ahead!

## Photon2 Set Up
- [Photon2 Set Up Tutorial](https://github.com/loopstick/Photon2_Tutorial/blob/main/README.md#start-here)

I followed the initial set-up steps in the above tutorial and connected my device to Berkeley IoT after arriving on campus.

After setting up my Photon2 mainboard, I tried some sample programs on it. The first program I attempted was the "helloworld" example.

Next, I connected the circuit according to the diagram and attempted the 'blink' example to make an external LED blink.

I also attempted to light up both the internal and external LEDs using the provided example.

Then, I connected a sensor to my circuit and used 'analogRead()' to gather data from the sensor. Here is the output from the serial monitor.

## Speculation & Reflection
In our next project we will explore the topic of the digital ecosystem. A digital ecosystem refers to the interconnected network of digital platforms, technologies, and services that collaborate to create, deliver, and consume digital goods and services. It encompasses various elements, including hardware, software, applications, data, and the users who interact with them. 

The proliferation of IoT devices has expanded digital ecosystems to include physical objects connected to the internet. These devices collect and exchange data, creating new opportunities for innovation and automation. For example, smart home ecosystems like Google Home or Amazon Alexa integrate various devices (e.g., thermostats, lights, security systems) to provide centralized control and automation.

I am excited about using Photon2 to create interconnected systems that align with the topic of the digital ecosystem. Some of my ideas include combining Photon2 with AR/VR techniques that can lead to innovative and immersive experiences. I would like to explore the possibilities of building a project for educational use that incorporates Photon2 to interact with the AR environment.
