# Weekly Report 4 - 09/14/2023 - 09/21/2023

## Summary
This week, we finished our first project in computational design and moved on to project 2. This time, we'll be utilizing Photon2 (looks similar to Arduino) for our upcoming project. I took some time this week to get myself familiar with Photon2 by following the provided tutorial and uploading sample programs onto the board. I'm excited about the prospect of creating fun projects in the weeks ahead!
