# Weekly Report 8 - 10/12/2023 - 10/19/2023

## Summary
This week, we successfully completed Project 2. In this project, we effectively utilized two Photon boards for signal transmission through the Particle web and employed Unity to read and display data via the serial port. We designed a mobile device capable of gathering information about the environment surrounding plants, and shaped the device using CAD modeling. Additionally, we crafted a 3D scene of a virtual garden in Unity to showcase plant models and environmental data.

## Project 2 Progress

## Speculation
1. Due to sensor limitations, our prototype currently only displays two pieces of data related to plant growth: sunlight intensity and soil moisture. As a potential future development, we could integrate more sensors into the mobile device to gain a more comprehensive understanding of plant growth ecology.

2. We aim to incorporate machine learning algorithms to enable the function of capturing photos for plant type identification and generating corresponding 3D plant models within the scenes. We may achieve this by providing keywords through the algorithm to generate images in Midjourney, and then converting the model through an AI-driven picture processing method.

3. The current prototype exists as a Unity 3D scene. In the future, we aspire to enhance both the scene and its interactive elements into a VR format to further heighten the sense of immersion.
