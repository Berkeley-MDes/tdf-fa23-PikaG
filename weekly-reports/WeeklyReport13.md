# Weekly Report 13 - 11/16/2023 - 11/23/2023

## Final Project Progress Report
- **The Mechanism of the Flower:**
Our team worked on our final project this week, and we have made a lot of progress. We constructed a mechanism for the flower and successfully connected it to the servo motor, controlling it with the Arduino for testing purposes. We will continue working on generating desired origami patterns that can be applied to our project.

- **Data Visualization Panel:**
We also worked on the data visualization aspect. After checking in with TJ, we sought out information and tutorials about Power BI integration and attempted to follow the instructions. We have now integrated Particle Cloud with Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. The next step is to generate data visualizations in Power BI using this setup.
