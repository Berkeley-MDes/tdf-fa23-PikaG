# Weekly Report 14 - 11/23/2023 - 11/30/2023

## Final Project Progress Report
- We tested on the origami flower and control it with photon and servo motor.

- We laser cut a box to hold the mechanical structure and to cover the photon boards. We first tried to sand the box but then we decided to use moss to cover the surface, so that it can better convey the concept of a garden.

- We combined all the parts together and tested on the circuit. All things work well now!

## Next Step
Before the final showcase, there are still some work needs to be done:
- Use laser cut to create a smaller box to cover the photon board connecting the sensors.
- Use laser cut to create more smaller origami flowers as decoration.
- Cover the other sides of the "garden" with more moss.
