# Weekly Report 10 - 10/26/2023 - 11/2/2023

## Summary
This week, I completed my chat box by incorporating the project information I worked on during the TDF course. In order to make my AI reflect my personality more accurately, I also included my resume and a description of my personality to assist in adjusting the tone.

## Project 3 Update
- Here is a preview of my chatbox. I created a list of questions used to test my AI, including basic information check such as "what is your name" and "tell me about your interests;" I also included questions related to my projects such as "what was the biggest challenge you encountered during project 2" and "Based on your work, what are your speculations about the future of Digital Ecosystems."

- To begin this project, I created several instructions and iterated through these instructions to adjust the AI chatbox. After I created knowledge sets containing my project information, I also linked them to the corresponding instrucions.
